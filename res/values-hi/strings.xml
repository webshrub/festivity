    <string name="festival_content">Before the advent of Islam in Arabia, there is mention of
        festivals as well as some others among the Arabs. The Israelites had festivals as well, but
        as is evident from the Old Testament and other scriptures, these festivals related more to
        commemorating certain days of their history.
        Eid al-Fitr was originated by the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It is observed on the first of
        the month of Shawwal at the end of the month of Ramadan, during which Muslims undergo a
        period of fasting.
        According to certain traditions, these festivals were initiated in Madinah after the
        migration of Muhammad from Mecca. Anas reports:
        When the Prophet arrived in Madinah, he found people celebrating two specific days in which
        they used to entertain themselves with recreation and merriment. He asked them about the
        nature of these festivities at which they replied that these days were occasions of fun and
        recreation. At this, the Prophet remarked that the Almighty has fixed two days [of
        festivity] instead of these for you which are better than these: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha
        For Muslims, both the festivals of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are occasions of showing
        gratitude to God and remembering Him, and are an occasion of entertainment. ‘Aishah narrates
        that when on an Eid day her father Abu Bakr stopped young girls from singing, Muhammad said:
        Abu Bakr! [Let them sing]; every nation has an ‘id and [this day] is our Eid.
